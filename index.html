    <i>  I am a very consistent and punctual boy in my class. Being a dedicated
      my goals, I always stand first in my class because of which I have bagged
      many awards. I always try to improve my skills and morals to become a
      better student. I do this by helping my classmates with love and
      dedication. I love to study storybooks as a pastime. I am also learning
      cycling so that I can keep myself healthy. I believe, one should practice
      a lot of sports to keep oneself healthy. A healthy mind works better. So,
      it is very important to keep yourself healthy to get focused. I am also
      very fond of watching various movies and I love to dance. I have learned
      many forms of dance ranging from hip-hop to breakdance. Being a lover of
      various dances, I also love to participate in various curricular
      activities in my school.</i><br><p> I am an active participant in a bunch of fests
      organized by my school. Also, I have been a part of several quizzes
      debates, and tabloids. I have a huge interest in quizzes and have bagged
      many awards and honors to my school. Moreover, I always try to keep myself
      very punctual to school and help poor people whenever I get a chance. I
      love to research the undiscovered things in this world which is why I
      aspire to become a scientist just like my father and work for my country.
      I am always thankful to my family and my friends for making me so humble
      and helping me every day trying to show me the goal amongst the bunch of
      cloudy weather.<p><b><mark> life is a jar of both happiness as well as sadness.</mark>
      Getting always what we want, is not the nature of life. Thus, one needs to
      keep oneself always motivated to the highest level. Follow the footprints
      of the great men to never be discouraged and keep yourself focused on your
      goal‚Äù.</b></p>
